### Hi friend, does this ever happen to you?

```ruby
== Sinatra (v2.0.5) has taken the stage on 4567 for development with backup from Thin
Thin web server (v1.7.2 codename Bachmanity)
Maximum connections set to 1024
Listening on localhost:4567, CTRL+C to stop
Stopping ...
== Sinatra has ended his set (crowd applauds)

### Damn. I closed my terminal window before shutting down my server. Now my port is blocked.

<br>

### Annoying, huh? Well here's how to fix the problem:

<br>

##### Option 1: Restart your computer. This will kill all running processes, thus freeing up that blocked port.
```
$ sudo reboot
```

<br>

##### Option 2: Identify the ID of the process using the port, then manually kill that process.
```
$ lsof -i :4567
  COMMAND  PID            USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
  ruby    9154 michaeljacobson   13u  IPv6 0xf5969a74d382b50b      0t0  TCP localhost:tram (LISTEN)
$ kill 9154
```

<br>

##### Option 3: Use freeportâ„¢ to do all that heavy lifting for you! Simply install by running the following in your terminal...
```
$ curl -sSL https://freeport.herokuapp.com | sudo sh
```

##### ...then all you have to do is run freeport, with the port that's blocked...
```
$ freeport 4567
  Port 4567 is now free
```

##### ... and voila!

Please note, freeport is not _actually_ trademarked...
